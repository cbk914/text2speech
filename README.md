# text2speech
Script to interact with Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API. Conversion to SSML, export to WAV, MP3 and OGG and other cool functions.

# Installation and usage

* Ensure Python 3.7 or later is installed on your machine. You can check your Python version using the command python --version in your terminal.
* Create a new virtual environment (optional, but recommended). You can do this with the following commands:

  `python -m venv env`
  `source env/bin/activate`
  
  On Windows use 
  
    `env\Scripts\activate`

* Install the required packages:

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Save your Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API credentials JSON file to your project directory.
* Create a .env file in your project directory and set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS variable to the path of your credentials JSON file:

  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path_to_your_credentials.json"

Now, to use the program, navigate to the directory containing text2speech.py and run:

  `python text2speech.py`

The program will guide you through a series of prompts to configure language, gender of the voice, and to select the text file to convert to speech.
It will split the file by time marks in format '[00:00:00]', generating as many files as tags found, under corresponding directory.
